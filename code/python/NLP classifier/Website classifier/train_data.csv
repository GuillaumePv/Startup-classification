"155","www.cmail.rocks","OPEN","<U+FEFF> cmail: Overview cmail Internet mail processing suite with SQLite backend cmail is an implementation of multiple protocols to fulfill most, if not all functions commonly expected in internet message exchange - commonly known as ""mail server"". Architecturally, cmail is split into several modules which interface through a central SQLite database (the master database ). For most modules, a administration tool is SMTP server (Accept incoming originated mails) POP server (Access mailboxes via POP) IMAP server (Access mailboxes via IMAP) SMTP client (Deliver outgoing mails to remote servers) HTTP API to the master database Web mailer interface HTTP Administration interface Manage cmail users Administration of inbound mail paths Administration of outbound mail handling Control access to the POP3 interface Read more about the system architecture in the architecture & development information section . Interested in using cmail? Try our installation guide and the accompanying upgrade guide . Development Rationale cmail was started out of resignation over the complexity involved in configuring and running many other As such, the configuration file format is relatively simple and only affects the specifics of the module it is written For the most part the configuration files consist of directives specifying on which ports the module should provide its The primary objective of the project is to provide an , and secure mail server for that simply want to send and receive mails on their Other use cases are, of course, supported, but not with as high a The common configuration, such as local addresses, routing decisions and user data are kept in the master This provides flexibility of reconfiguration without restarting the modules, as well as allowing for the use of a variety of interfaces to configure the server, such as the provided Web Panel or an SQLite database cmail was intentionally kept simple in terms of configuration as well as It might not support some features experienced administrators may be accustomed to Most of it can probably be enabled or emulated with sufficient thought, Should that not be enough, you can extend cmail either by modyfing the purposely slim codebase or by interfacing with a (not yet implemented, but planned) internal API for modifying its behaviour with shared libraries (plugins). If cmail still does not meet your expectations after that, you might be better off using another MTA :) Current state & coarse roadmap As the main developers have transitioned from university into jobs, development has slowed However, multiple cmail systems are in full productive use and the architecture has proven to be very The primary criticism so far is missing support for IMAP, which is in slow progress, both due to the aforementioned lack of time as well as the pecularities of the IMAP The following coarse roadmap illustrates the progress we currently aim for Basic implementation (2019) Initial public packaged release (2019) This listing should not be taken at face Development pace is not easy to estimate, and features may be postponed because of lack of interest or more pressing For finer grained lists, check the individual module folders in the repository for files named Common use cases server, mail is sent via external servers The following modules are involved for receiving incoming mail or for access to mailboxes Optionally: and for easier administration Optionally: and for web access to mailboxes server This use case might be better served by nullmailer . Using cmail, you d need for accepting originated mail for delivering the outbound mail Optionally: and for easier administration and This setup involves the following modules for receiving incoming mail and or for access to mailboxes for delivering the outbound mail Optionally: and for easier administration Optionally: and for web access to mailboxes Contributing & Contact Our main development languages are C (daemons), PHP (API backend) and JavaScript HTML (web interface).

been thinking about starting your homestead, I<U+0092>ve created a guide that will teach you everything you need to know to get Homesteads are practically a completely home typically located on a property out of They are usually placed on land with natural resources to provide for homestead residents and The simplicity of it is starting to prosper in popularity unlike ever before, and we don<U+0092>t blame It allows for a complete disconnection of reliance on city life<U+0092>s These are things such as being connected to commercial electricity, cable, water, and the inability to live by using natural resources like creeks, livestock, crops, and much It<U+0092>s a simple yet complex lifestyle that wildly calls minimalists to take action by leaving town and living Many think it<U+0092>s challenging, but this is not the I<U+0092>ve built a guide broken down into sections that is simple and straightforward to understand even for the biggest of novices, which will explain the big picture this way, building a homestead won<U+0092>t seem impossible or nearly as Let<U+0092>s dive into Finding the Perfect Location for your Homestead Natural Resources Are A Must A homestead is meant to be this means no access to city water, commercial electricity, or It<U+0092>s essentially a switch to liv ing entirely off the grid , without the help of being into the This implies that unless you plan to live like a cave dweller, you<U+0092>ll likely want to pick an area that is rich in natural This includes creeks, rivers, wildlife, good crop growth, and plenty of sun if you want to power your homestead using solar If you<U+0092>re going to build your homestead in a desert, you<U+0092>ll need to have a large water tank to provide for you and the You should not count on food to rely This is always an option, but having this in mind may take away motivation from truly going and maintaining an entirely property and Selecting The Best State Probably the most essential aspect is to find a state that works best for I<U+0092>ll say that some states have the edge over others, but you should not let others choose the state for This step may seem complicated, but it doesn<U+0092>t have to If you<U+0092>re going to build a homestead, you<U+0092>re probably going to live there for a long time so it<U+0092>s critical to choose a state that you Besides, homesteads can be built Nevertheless, a state with relaxed gun laws and homestead friendly regulations would suit you Protecting your homestead is High availability of natural resources would suit you much better than building it in a desert in California, although this is entirely Taking Laws Into Consideration A huge part of homesteading involves cutting off the government from controlling your Laws are a massive reason for many who choose to live a homestead These individuals seek to get away from the endless regulations and other complicated laws commonly enforced in city If you<U+0092>re building a homestead, the first thing to watch out for is gun While firearms are certainly not needed, they will undoubtedly protect your property, and don<U+0092>t forget guns can also be used for Other essential factors include regulations and Many states have statutes that make systems illegal or tax you for various reasons on top of an already high state Before you choose a state, taking a look at these factors is critical to becoming educated this way, you make the best possible decision of where you<U+0092>ll build your Building The Homestead The Foundation Building a solid foundation is where it all This process is pretty straightforward, but there are several options to choose The first that I<U+0092>ll mention are If you choose to go with this, it will cost you more than most other options, and they<U+0092>re atypical of homestead foundations and require more work and You could also consider a concrete slab foundation these are very strong and but You also have crawl space foundations, which, as the name suggests, allows you to crawl Crawl space foundations are very cheap and straightforward to They<U+0092>re typically built on top of stacked bricks or some other type of Framing The Homestead After you<U+0092>ve laid the foundation, you<U+0092>ll need to start framing the I<U+0092>d recommend that you now begin drawing out the floor This way, you can get the walls built before you stand them up, readying them to become one with the It<U+0092>s also a good idea to cut out any windows and doors before you stand the walls The types of material that you decide to use is essential, as cheap wood can bend, flex, and crack You<U+0092>ll want to use wood unless you<U+0092>re using This will prevent any unwanted circumstances from arising like rotting and result in a stronger Once you<U+0092>ve got your walls installed, it<U+0092>s time for a You should remember that before you add any sheetrock, it<U+0092>s a good idea to install the plumbing and Choosing A Roof This is where the fun starts, in my The roof is the final thing to add before you can really start seeing it all come There are several types of roofs to choose You have the more typical roofs like those built using asphalt shingles, but if you<U+0092>re like most people, you enjoy the sound of rain hitting a tin This is why I<U+0092>d recommend that you use tin sheets, which are surprisingly cheap and easily replaced if You also have green roofs, which may seem like a good idea considering it<U+0092>d be placed on a homestead, but the lifespan is nearly of most other roofs, and they require an immense amount of support and If it were me, I<U+0092>d choose a tin roof this way I save money and can easily replace any sheets if needed for Planning The Interior After you<U+0092>ve laid the foundation, framed the house together, including any walls, windows, and doors, and you<U+0092>ve installed the roof, it<U+0092>s time to start deciding what you<U+0092>ll do to the interior of the This is a personal preference, so it<U+0092>s going to differ from person to person as to what you However, I<U+0092>d recommend that you consider choosing a floor that is easily Carpets will almost certainly get stained because you<U+0092>ll likely have livestock and gardens, both of which will likely cause muddy There isn<U+0092>t much else to recommend here, because your floor plan is probably very different from It<U+0092>s a good idea to be simple, Anything you do to the interior should flow smoothly with the rest of the Important Factors Using The Best Building Material There are several types of homesteads, many of which use very different material types, ranging from rustic, modern, and everything in A prevalent option that is being used currently is aluminum sheds, which are often large and cheap the traditional wooden These are great options, but they do not offer the classic feel of a rustic Luckily there are numerous types of material in terms of building blocks to use to build your If you want to stay on a budget, you could use self obtained logs located on the property If you<U+0092>re going to use the wood found on the property, it will need some preparation If you<U+0092>re going to build a homestead with a modern build type similar to houses, then the typical framing often used to build a modern family home will work, although this will cost a bit more than using Growing A Garden A homestead would not be complete without a thriving garden . Garden<U+0092>s come in all types, shapes, and sizes, featuring just about any veggies you<U+0092>d If you plan to make your garden a large part of your food supply, you<U+0092>ll want to make sure what you grow can sustain Cabbage and tomatoes seem great, but you<U+0092>ll need a bit more than just those to have a decent supply of A few good ideas of what to grow could be zucchini, pepper plants, squash, greens, corn, onions, beets, or peas, to name a Whichever veggies you prefer, make sure they can grow for the majority of the year this depends on the climate, of You<U+0092>ll want to make sure it<U+0092>s large enough as well, a <d7>10 is easily maintainable, but it will not be enough to sustain you all year, especially if it<U+0092>s your primary food Shoot for a size of <d7>50 at a Homing The Livestock Livestock is what makes a homestead a homestead . They not only provide milk, cheese, leather, and other useful materials but also provide horsepower (plows, ), so to say they are essential is an If you plan to have livestock on your homestead, you<U+0092>ll want to do it Even before you move the animals onto the property, first locate where you want them If it<U+0092>s chickens, nearby may be Cows or Horses will be better placed in a larger area, such as a Once you<U+0092>ve decided where you<U+0092>ll put them, build an adequate shelter for A good thing to do before you home the livestock is to create an easily accessible water feed system preemptively, so it<U+0092>s uncomplicated to maintain the This means automatic feeders, clean water access, and adequate This step is vital because you want the livestock to flow together as a system with the rest of the Options Being in a homestead is crucial! Keep these options in Electricity Homesteads are meant to be entirely , which means no power You could homestead without power, but since most people will not give this luxury up (I don<U+0092>t blame them), we<U+0092>ll recommend the best options for The first option is by using a generator . This would be perfect for individuals who will rarely use electricity, as they are cheap and provide adequate electricity for just about There are also types of generators charged via solar, which leads to our next method solar Initially, these are a bit However, they typically last a long time, and they will pay for themselves They can be placed on roofs or stands near the We have reviewed quite a few located Water This is where the cost can skyrocket because you may need to install a water well if there is no access to water, which is why finding an area rich in natural resources or building in a climate that provides rain is Hand pumps are also a great option, but keep in mind that it may not provide enough water for the livestock unless you have many hand You could also consider storage tanks, which could be filled via haulage to town to There are systems as well, which is something to consider, but again, in dry months, it may not supply an adequate amount of Overall, I<U+0092>d recommend looking into a well powered by a solar, windmill or refilling water storage via haulage to If your homestead property has a creek, this could also be a great Frequently Asked Questions How Do I Determine What<U+0092>s Legal?

Fourthly, if my application failed here with Harmoney, few would know - my bank would be none the wiser anyway - but the same learning would still have taken place for me which in turn would have helped me set new goals anyway, financial and I m still not close to my financial goals for my lifetime but I m still a lot further ahead than most my age in planning and providing for my Investing in my ChCh house will certainly help bring it up to a better standard when I ll be selling it in years (Christmas ) Thanks again for financing this and I am quite sincere in The reality is that no bank would have advanced this money for me and you are the best of all the NZ lenders that I have dealt with in my time as an almost year Robert Canterbury, New Zealand Muni Excellent customer service, no other lenders can beat Harmoney<U+0092>s quick Loan sorted in new zealand Trudie I think you have a great team I am more than happy with your service, approachability and fast You are are fair the best finance company I have ever had to deal I have recommended Harmoney to all of my collages and Thank New Zealand Joachim Customer service outstanding!!!

What we can do As you can find out if you browse our profiles, we<U+0092>re experienced with projects involving: mapping objects in images to their positions in the real world classifying, locating, segmenting and recognizing objects in images, mostly (but not only) using neural nets designing, training and deploying neural nets for the above purposes, and some others, too (e.g., improving video quality) We<U+0092>re also used to having to read a lot (research). This way we<U+0092>ve been able to tackle a large variety of projects, as you can see in our Note: at some point, Bogdan took the time to write everything he could remember having used, in terms of tech, on his personal It<U+0092>s a lengthy (and rather boring) read, but if you want you can access it here . How we do what we do We work closely with our clients throughout every stage of the process of making their ideas happen: understanding the business goals processes identifying stages in the pipeline which might benefit from using a CV ML approach researching the state of the art in the relevant field estimate the relative cost, time to market and expected performance of alternatives we find (or think of) solution design, implementation, testing, deployment and What we use Over time, we<U+0092>ve used several technologies (programming languages, libraries, frameworks ) to build the stuff we<U+0092>ve built, and, in the process, we<U+0092>ve grown more or less accustomed to some of them: Computer Vision: OpenCV (from both Python and C++ ), mahotas , , Deep Learning: TensorFlow ( Python for training & inference, C and Java for inference only), Keras , HyperOpt , , Caffe ( C++ , Python ), Theano , pylearn2 (really old framework) deployment: Docker , OpenAPI , pipenv generic data processing: NumPy statistics: pandas , , statsmodels data visualization: matplotlib (+ mpld3 ), seaborn , plotly GUI: Qt for Python ( PyQt5 , PyQt4 , PySide ) What we have Currently we have a few NVidia GPUs at our disposal for training and deploying neural We also have some code that we wrote for our clients in the past, for which we have kept the right to to further That code may be used for: training and applying neural nets: (bounding box) detectors using TensorFlow<U+0092>s Object Detection API keypoint detectors object segmentation deploying TensorFlow nets using Python, C (so not necessarily C++) and Java deploying nets training and inference services easily and in a scalable fashion using docker generate http endpoints for our deployed inference services quickly and easily using OpenAPI quickly feeding data to the training process of neural nets defined in keras detecting paper documents on flat surfaces green screen removal (keying) accurately estimate the position of objects relative to the camera given a few recognized points which respect some constraints known a priori other stuff I can<U+0092>t remember now, but probably will, if a problem arises that can be solved using that code Hosted on GitHub Pages <U+0097> Theme by orderedlist"

I challenged myself: ""Can you do it?"" And I got enrolled to the course after diligently making all test Not only do the Kottans explain the basics and repeat it a number of times to make material completely clear, but they also help to train very well (personally, my level has risen). And this is a big family - there is always support in chat rooms (if you<U+0092>re stuck), informal outdoor parties, And yes! I quickly found a Not after the first interview (you need to acquire some experience points in passing the interviews), but a housewife (with a long experience) without formal education started to work as a Junior developer in the Ministry of Finance (and coded not only HTML & CSS but did proper JS tasks). There is still a lot to learn, to grasp, to understand, and I manage it more or less quickly - the main thing is the start, and then it works like :) Recently I finished an interview task and thought to myself: could I even imagine a few months ago myself being able to make something like that? A wonderful feeling, I must The work was truly hard, and it will remain hard in the However if you progress at least in baby steps and with every step become better than your previous self, it s worth I wanted to join Kottans 2 years ago, but I thought it was too early for me and I would not make it, I thought I needed work experience But time passed, and no particular experience or knowledge appeared) because the right time is here and Until you try, you do not know what you really are capable of and in what direction you want to Kottans offer not only cool courses, but it<U+0092>s also a community, it s a whole There is no such thing as a dumb question Here you can both study and teach others, each time discovering new nuances of seemingly clear The course mentors deserve special They are people you respect, admire and on which you really want to be like, when you grow up)) Who else would explain seemingly obvious things to an unknown person several times without losing ? :) Things like this are very It s awesome to learn from those who believe that quality knowledge is not a business, but a way to make the IT industry well developed, more successful and You are cool, Kottans! Thank you! Before joining the Kottans course, I went to ""study"" to a small company to a friend of There I was immediately given React docs and told that this is how it After a month of such studies, I realized that I was clearly lacking the And then I came across the announcement of an online course from I took a look at the program - it was just what was And I think that is what all beginners The program is systematized by experienced developers, and includes subjects from the very basics to reasonably advanced things from the development Live communication from the very beginning of the online course with and reviews, an absolutely unique experience that is difficult to obtain even on paid By the way, the lack of a fee in itself is amazing in our time, and at the same time guarantees the transparency of motivation of mentors - they want to help people, and therefore the reviews were as detailed and qualitative as the course left only positive In addition, I got the opportunity to contribute to community life, which is invaluable in I am very satisfied with the course! Almost all of my expectations were confirmed: I found new friends, new colleagues, gained new knowledge, received valuable tips and code When I joined the course, I was already working as a frontend developer knowing HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript basics, but I knew I wanted to have a more solid understanding of modern approaches to JavaScript I am grateful to mentors and active students for their high professionalism and contribution to such a cool community, for their positive attitude, openness, valuable advice and enthusiasm! Personally, I was waiting for the next class not only to get a new batch of knowledge but also to hang out after class))) During the training, we tried to contribute to various initiatives of the Kottans: social network postings, mutual assistance, help to students from the p2p course and so And the pinnacle of teamwork for all of us was the Input Conference, which our cool team succeeded to organize! To our and mentor Oleksiy Rudenko great respect for the fact that he wonderfully led the whole process and was an example for us! In my opinion, communities like this one help to change our country for the better! After all, mutual assistance, communication, and cooperation are the keys to success! I am proud to be a Kottan! And I feel that after the courses I became more professional in my field, and also contributed something useful to this community! It s more than courses, it s a whole family! Every Saturday I wait as a holiday and I have great pleasure in going to But no matter how good is the support and no matter how good are the study materials, it s mainly about your If you do not devote time each day to practice and analyze each source code line, the result will not An easy way into the IT industry is a fairy You need to work on yourself and your But if you still decide to change your life, then you definitely need to go to Only modern technology stack, working programmers as mentors, not one, two, but many, and many of them will always answer your And most importantly, there is no such thing as a stupid question I am very glad that I joined them and became a part of a big Our friends & partners Open the site Open the site Open the site Open the site Open the site Join US + Want to help the community?

"474","www.mini-distribution.io","OPEN","Mini Distribution View on GitHub Mini Distribution A lightweight embedded GNU Linux distribution What is the Mini Distribution? The Mini Distribution is a modern lightweight GNU Linux Distribution for embedded It is built from collections of buildfiles using the Build Gear firmware build The Mini Distribution running on the The Mini Distrubtion also serves as a reference distribution and example on how to create firmware using the Build Gear build It is maintained by the Build Gear maintainers and community It includes a simple set of components and That being said you should be able to easily reuse, modify or extend it for your own In fact, we invite you to adopt the Mini Distribution for your hardware or create your own distribution if you Build Gear makes it easy to do! Features Glibc based toolchain Systemd init system GNU Linux system utilities (no busybox) Small footprint Up to date components Collection of + available buildfiles supporting various features Supported Hardware Currently the lead hardware for the Mini Distribution is the IMX6 Hummingboard from Solidrun . Previously supported hardware included the Raspberry Pi , Beaglebone , and Pandaboard . These are no longer maintained but their buildfiles are still If you would like to maintain the Mini Distribution for any of these boards or other boards please let us Source The buildfiles for the Hummingboard are available here: https: github.com mini-distribution hummingboard All Mini Distribution buildfiles are available here: https: github.com mini-distribution . The main buildfiles are split into 4 collections: core Buildfiles providing basic features (maintained on a regular basis) opt Buildfiles providing optional features (maintained on a regular basis) extra Buildfiles providing extra features (maintained on a basis) Each collection can be split into cross and native Cross buildfiles are those built to run on a host system (eg. arm) different from the system (typically x86) they are built Native buildfiles are those built to run on the same system (typically x86) they are built Generally, it is advised to avoid the use of native buildfiles and instead leverage the features of the available build system components (eg. Ubuntu packages) to reduce maintenance and compilation Downloads Prebuilt images are available http: mini-distribution.io prebuilds . How to install? For install instructions please see the README file in the respective board buildfile For the Hummingboard the README is found here: https: github.com mini-distribution hummingboard . How to build? To build the Mini Distribution you must first install the Build Gear firmware build Then, building the filesystem and bootloader for the Hummingboard is as easy as the following: $ git clone --recursive git: github.com mini-distribution hummingboard.git $ cd hummingboard $ buildgear build fs $ buildgear build This will make Build Gear automatically download the source code of all included filesystem components, resolve build dependencies, and build everything in correct order - the end result is a compressed filesystem tarball in the build output directory: build output fs.tar.gz Likewise the resulting bootloader is available in the build output directory: build output u-boot.img . The build also includes the first stage bootloader: build output SPL For more build details (build system requirements ) see the board README: https: github.com mini-distribution hummingboard . Please notice that it is only supported building the Mini Distribution using Other distributions installed on your build system are not officially However, others will likely work but use on your own risk! Mailing List Subscribe to the following mailing list for development, help, bug reports, announcements, discussions, : Build Gear Development Mailing List Contributing Feel free to contribute - the Mini Distribution is fully open source and open for ideas and patches which improve any of the available build If you want to help out drop by #buildgear and say We are always in need for maintainers to help maintain buildfiles and support for various hardware Mini Distribution Commit History Committer Repository Message Date Hosted by Midphase"

What sets Occidental apart from the rest? All auxlangs are made with the best of intentions and deserve Out of the hundreds and even thousands of proposed projects, the ones mentioned above are some of the very few that have ever managed to achieve an active user base, and that makes them Having said that, what makes Occidental unique is the following: It looks like a natural Most people conclude it must be a dialect similar to Catalan or Occitan, spoken in the area between Spain and And that means that: It s remarkably easy to About one or two billion people can work their way through an Occidental text without ever having seen one However, it s still a language created to be as easy as It s a language that you can learn in a few weeks and come out knowing how to read a lot of related languages like Italian and French without having studied them And as the next question shows, you<U+0092>ll come out knowing a lot more about English Some of the auxlangs above have an appearance as natural as Occidental, and others have a grammar as (and even a little bit more) But no language has managed to blend a natural look and regular grammar as well as Occidental That s why it took its creator years to put it I learned about Interlingua first and Occidental (Interlingue) looks really similar to Why do people choose Occidental over Interlingua? By and large it is a bad idea to talk down other planned They all have their own adherents who join them for perfectly good reasons, and their own reasons for staying as Nevertheless, Occidental Interlingu e and Interlingu a have such a close history that mentioning one often results in being questioned about the There was a mass movement of Occidentalists to the and New Interlingua in the (Occidental being and based in Europe). Then there was a similar movement in the opposite direction after the advent of the People who gave Esperanto a try, then gave naturalism a try with Interlingua, eventually discovered that it was Occidental that they were looking for all Part of this comes from the passage of time: Europe is no longer a continent and the original funding for Interlingua has long since dried up (along with the buzz it had in the ). What is left are two languages with fairly active communities that are now only judged on their own So without getting into too much detail, Occidental is for many of us what we hoped Interlingua would be when we were first attracted to it - a planned language that is mostly understandable at first sight, charming and pleasant to look at and listen to, and regular and easy to What does regular and easy to learn mean? The clearest difference is probably seen in De Wahl s Rule which regularizes the creating of words from all verbs except six exceptions, while in student has a lot more to memorize . For more details, we will be adding articles from the old issues of Cosmoglotta in the as they are They can be seen THE MOTE AND THE BEAM (Schematism and naturalism in international languages) Why should I spend time learning Occidental instead of a natural language? Occidental can be thought of as the simplified and tidied up quintessence of the Western European languages, or rather Europe<U+0092>s The common vocabulary is connected but hidden, and Occidental makes it Take the word father for Why is it patre and not some other word? It<U+0092>s because it serves the key role in words related to it that we all patre ( patr <U+00B7>e) father patria ( patr <U+00B7>ia) homeland (fatherland) expatriate (ex<U+00B7> patr <U+00B7>ia<U+00B7>t<U+00B7>e) expatriate (ex means out, from, or out from) patriarch ( patr <U+00B7>i<U+00B7>arch) patriarch patriot ( patr <U+00B7>i<U+00B7>ot) patriot patriotisme ( patr <U+00B7>i<U+00B7>ot<U+00B7>isme) patriotism repatriation (re<U+00B7> patr <U+00B7>i<U+00B7>a<U+00B7>t<U+00B7>ion) repatriation Now in other languages this is hidden: patre is p<e8>re in French (the t is gone), padre in But when we get to the derived terms, we see the t come This is the ingrained common root that Occidental Occidental French Spanish patre p<e8>re padre expatriate expatri<e9> <e9> expatriado a patriarch patriarche patriarca patriot patriote patriota patriotisme patriotisme patriotismo repatriation rapatriement repatriaci<f3>n When you know Occidental, the common roots simply become visible in a way excelled by maybe only Have a look over the following list and see just how clear the vocabulary becomes when expressed in Intervalle (interval), formed from inter (between) and valle (mound, bulwark). Literal meaning: a ""between-walls<U+0094>. <cd>nevitabil (inevitable), formed from <ed>n (reverses the meaning), evitar (to evade) <U+2192> evit<U+00B7>abil. Literal meaning: <U+0093>un-evade-able<U+0094>. burgeonant (burgeoning): a burgeon is a bud in Then verbalized as burgeonar <U+2192> burgeona<U+00B7>nt vernal (vernal): Think of the vernal equinox, the day in March when day and night are of equal length and spring officially In Occidental verne means spring radicalisme (radicalism): the word radica means A radical is someone <U+0093>rooted<U+0094> in an seculari (secular): a secul is a century in - ari turns it into an adjective meaning something of this era (something that is a product of its time). nomination (nomination): a n<f3>mine is a This one is easy: a nomination is literally a <U+0093>naming<U+0094>. So when you read Occidental, you have a stronger idea of what the words mean? That s It s almost as if English looked like this, with hints everywhere about the meaning of the words we use everyday: Morning! How was your break fast? Pretty Nothing like breaking your fast with ham and Hey, do we have to work to morrow? Isn t to morrow a holyday? Let s morrow is Odinsday, right? No, that s to day!

It is a valid concern that Occidental is in the uncanny valley for Romance language speakers in However, see this quote below: The ""Uncanny Valley"" is much the same as what I ve called the ""Rube Effect"": a feature of a system that makes me feel illiterate for using [...] My point was that if there is a slight resemblance between the new system and ones already known, you can accept it as coincidence and use it as a mnemonic, but if the resemblance is great, then any deviation will be perceived as an Thus the ""Romance"" aspect of Esperanto is fairly low, so it doesn t bother me when it does something But when Interlingua does something , such as not having multiple negation (which Occidental does allow), it not only seems wrong, but almost deceptive: I feel set up, taken in by its Romance Because Occidental doesn t look entirely Romance (the pronoun ""it,"" past tense in , ""lass,"" ""mey,"" ) I may find it annoying, perhaps, but I don t feel I once wrote that when you visit Interlingua, it answers the door in a Romance mask, ushers you inside, exchanges pleasantries, and goes to get you some Then it pours the tea on your head and reverts to the ""Is something wrong?"" When you visit Occidental, it resembles some Romance languages you ve known, but it looks more like a creole of Romance and It almost immediately slaps you in the face, says, ""I m not Romance,"" and then invites you in and is a gracious In other words, it establishes independence early on, and you either accept it or Interlingua maintains a Romance guise most of the time, only to do something really alien when you aren t expecting This is why I kept seeing native speakers of Romance languages trying to fix Interlingua: when you try something that seems odd, even though the grammar may specifically permit it, you re You cannot really say ""Ille vide me,"" even though it s technically allowed (it is completely acceptable as ""Il vide me"" in Occidental). Steve Rice in Auxlang Listserv Esperanto and other auxlangs only use a few suffixes to form words while Occidental has quite a Why not use fewer? The suffixes in Occidental are in fact already present in Esperanto and similar languages (substanco, direktoro, sentimento, spekulativa, ). The difference is that in Occidental these are regularly formed using its own internal rules (sub + star + = substantie, directer + = director, sentir + = sentiment, specular + de Wahl s rule + iv = speculativ, ) and do not need to be imported as foreign [More details] What if we need to create new words today? Occidental was created to follow a natural evolution similar to the natural languages, where usage or lack of it decides the fate of a And Occidental s large body of literature and wealth of suffixes taken from the natural languages makes the creation of new words Here for example is an article published in on atomic theory in Occidental when the field was completely new, showing how easily it dealt with the new nomenclature with words such as atomic (atom<U+00B7>ic), ionisation (ion<U+00B7>isar - ion<U+00B7>isa<U+00B7>t<U+00B7>ion), resonantie (re<U+00B7>son<U+00B7>ar - re<U+00B7>sona<U+00B7>nt<U+00B7>ie), and so Because of this, the best way to create new words is to simply learn the language On top of this, Occidental does not require any specific endings for words so international words can generally be imported without Occidental looks very Does a word in Occidental have to match a Romance word to be correct? Not at Occidental tends to form words that either match an existing international word, are very close to one, or one that other languages could have created themselves but simply have We do not hesitate to form words like <U+0093>ludette, plorada, substantival, pruntation, credaci, perdibil, leonello, musicastro, plumallia, tassade, sucrage, glotton, stridore, hesitatori, successosi, flexura<U+0094> without asking ourselves whether these words are international or always represent forms that living languages would have been able to produce using their own Alphonse Matejka in Autonomie e Regularita in li Lingue International (1948) How can I get involved with the Occidental language and contribute? The fun thing about Occidental as a language is that you can start to contribute to it and give it new life pretty quickly after getting the basics On top of that, because it is also an auxlang with a long history, it has a lot of existing content and established infrastructure that new languages are still working That means it has: A Wikipedia that you can contribute It has its own Wiktionary , but you can also add the Occidental equivalents to words on Wiktionaries in other languages as See the translations in airport , for In Glosbe you can add words and translation Translation memories are very important as they show how a word works in Here is one example . To add translation memories you can go through the back issues of Cosmoglotta here and look for sentences to translate into English or your own You can add sentences to Tatoeba as As of August , Occidental (Interlingue) has over phrases and is in You can translate some of the content from the English Wikipedia page on Interlingue into your own This page was recently added to and has become 5 times larger and more detailed than it was a year ago, so there is a lot of new information to translate into other And of course, just by learning the language and interacting with the community , you are contributing! <U+00A9> Contribute on GitHub"

Software programs exploiting these new instructions can express complex search and inference problems without committing to a particular search The probabilistic semantics are available to programming languages such as C C++ and View details <U+00BB> Applications Generate exercises for adaptive digital education that are guaranteed to practice certain Generate puzzles, maps, and scenarios for games that are guaranteed to exercise key game mechanics or drive narrative Recover most likely solutions and enumerate Use statistical user models in simulation to sample behaviors, allowing design prior to View details <U+00BB> Technology The radically new machine instructions are implemented, not in expensive physical hardware, but in software simulators that apply powerful combinatorial search and optimization algorithms behind the These systems implement advanced techniques from formal verification and probabilistic inference to sample feasible executions with strong View details <U+00BB> Code Example Problem Definition Suppose we want to generate simple linear equations to be included in a student s mathematics We ll generate equations of the form a x + b = c where a and x are small positive numbers and b and c are positive and possibly C Source (what you write) Let s use the C interface to implement our equation The abstraction it provides is a random number generator with perfect foresight <U+0097> it will never return values that lead to trouble later We ll ask it to uniformly sample values for a , x , b , and c filtered by the condition that the equation actually Simply sampling random integer coefficients without constraint doesn t work because the equation is very likely to have a fractional solution (e.g., 2 x + 1 == 2 implies x == ), a situation that might not be appropriate for students at their current level of int main() if(oracle_acquire()) Fork alternative executions int a = oracle_uniform_int(1, ) Draw integer values from the int x = oracle_uniform_int(1, ) bounded uniform int b = oracle_uniform_int(1, ) int c = oracle_uniform_int(1, ) oracle_ensure( a x + b == c ) Prevent executions where condition does not oracle_release() Mark this execution as printf(""[a=%d] [x=%d] + [b=%d] == [c=%d]\n"", a, x, b, c) else printf(""no solutions!\n"") Compiled Machine Code (what gets simulated) Here s a look at how the C compiler encodes the program Because our probabilistic extension follows the extension guidelines, existing utilities such as compilers, debuggers, profilers, and disassemblers can read and write probabilistic executables without any Probabilistic instructions are shown here in At this level, it starts to feel like we really have an Infinite Improbability Drive integrated as physical <main : : custom0 a5,zero,zero,0 #

A backend system based on this approach will be very fast to start up and will quickly return solutions if the search problem is easy : when a significant fraction of the potential executions are feasibile ( oracle_ensure checks pass). For hard problems, where the chance of hitting a feasible execution via forward sampling is astronomically low, an approach that can exploit the deep structure of the search problem is In the second approach, we ll use formal verification techniques to seek out those extremely rare Software model checkers, such as CBMC , work by transforming the program into a constraint satisfaction solvers for these problems then either find a satisfying solution (the ingredients of a feasible execution trace) or formally prove that no solutions In exchange for longer times, these approaches provide the best available performance on hard search Care is needed to ensure that the solutions resulting from this process arise with the correct distribution, however recent research on approximate probabilistic inference provides a solid theoretical foundation For resource constrained environments that cannot host the solving process, this computation can be securely delegated to an external service in a new kind of cloud computing Because our users will be expressing both easy and hard search problems <U+0097> what matters is that the problems are easy for human programmers to express in languages <U+0097> Quasilinear Research provides several backend inference systems that make different design Newly developed backends will be compatible with existing compiled software that targets the fixed Probabilistic Defining search problems at the level of machine language allows inference providers to exploit a specification of the search problem without requiring users to reveal their private source Users may program in the language of their choice, even if that language is internal to their organization (presuming it can be compiled for or interpreted by our probabilistic machine abstraction). Probabilistic Processors Quasilinear Research is developing a probabilistic processor model , defined in the Chisel hardware description language, to capture the execution of software in terms of the logic primitives understood by existing search and inference Depending on the type of work performed in the user s probabilistic program, different probabilistic processor models will be appropriate (e.g., including or excluding hardware support for complex math operators, and varying the effective number of parallel hardware threads or harts ).

Reproducibility and replicability of research results have gained a lot of interest recently with assessment studies being led in various fields, and they are often seen as a trigger for better result diffusion and In this project, we assess replicability in Computer Graphics, by evaluating whether the code is available and whether it works As a proxy for this field we compiled, ran and analyzed codes out of papers from SIGGRAPH conferences (exhaustive for , and ). In the analysis described in Nicolas Bonneel, David Coeurjolly, Julie Digne, Nicolas Mellado, Code Replicability in Computer Graphics , ACM on Graphics (Proceedings of SIGGRAPH ), :4, we show a clear increase in the number of papers with available and operational research codes with a dependency on the subfields, and exhibit a correlation between code replicability and citation This website provides an interactive tool to explore our results and evaluation It also provides tools to comment on the various codes either as an author or as a All materials (data, ) that have been used to generate these results are available on the GitHub project .

I<U+0092>ll be at Alfresco Summit this year in Barcelona talking about what was involved in the migration, both from a project management and from a technical standpoint in my talk Lessons Learned from Share Extras . You can catch me in Boston too, and at both conferences you<U+0092>re welcome to book a time to chat about Alfresco Integrations, Share Extras or in general at the Alfresco Experts Posted in Share Extras Changes to Transformers configuration in Alfresco Posted on July 9, by wabson If like me you have configured some custom transformers against the Alfresco repository in order to convert from one file type to another, you<U+0092>ll need to be aware of some changes that have been made in the codeline currently available in the HEAD branch in SVN and in the latest nightly builds . The major change is that the mimetype mappings which were previously defined via the Spring bean definitions have now moved to repository This has the benefit that the Spring configuration is much simpler and sys admins can more easily change which transformers are used for specific transforms, as well as the priority assigned to Today I added some default properties to the on Share Extras, which you may find useful as a guide to converting over any custom transformer Previously in the project, the transformer mimetype mappings were defined on the transformers<U+0092> Spring beans via the explicitTransformations Here is an <bean id=""transformer.ffmpeg.flv"" ... <property name=""explicitTransformations"" <list <bean class=""org.alfresco.repo.content.transform.ExplictTransformationDetails"" <property name=""sourceMimetype"" <value video mpeg< value < property <property name=""targetMimetype"" <value video x-flv< value < property < bean ... < list < property ... < bean This configuration configures this a transformer with the bean ID , which is capable of converting an file to Flash Video format (note that the transformation itself is performed by a separate worker bean since Alfresco , and that whilst not generally recommended, the explicitTransformation list can also be applied to that bean). In onwards the explicitTransformation property is no longer used, so we must define the following repository properties in addition to the Spring # Define a default priority for this transformer =50 # List the transformations that are supported =true =50 ... It is important to get the format of the properties right, with a prefix of followed by the Spring bean ID of the transformer ( in this case), followed by the suffixes First we define a numerical priority for this transformer, then each supported transformation must be listed separately, one on each line, with the source and target mimetypes identified by their default file extensions, which can be obtained from the mimetypes web script, http: localhost:8080 alfresco service mimetypes . As per Alan<U+0092>s advice on this related JIRA ticket , you can simply add the properties to your installation<U+0092>s , and they will take effect immediately after a restart, but if your transformer config is packaged up in an then you probably want to ship these properties with it, otherwise the transformer will be automatically configured to transform any mimetype into all others defined in the system (see this issue if you want to understand the consequences of this). For the project I utilised the ability of Alfresco Subsystems to pull in extended configuration properties placed on the classpath under alfresco extension subsystems .

Posted on February 1, by wabson If you<U+0092>ve been following the recent activity on Share Extras you<U+0092>ll notice that most of the work for the last few weeks has been going into the Media Viewers project and in particular the <U+0091>PdfJs<U+0092> based viewer which it If you<U+0092>re not familiar with the underlying project then you should know that it provides a means of direct rendering of PDF content items using HTML5 and JavaScript in the web browser, with no requirement from additional plugins such as Combined with the ability of the Alfresco repository to transform just about any standard document into PDF format, we think this provides a compelling reason to try the Media Viewer if you have not done so An initial version of the PdfJs viewer shipped in the Media Viewers release for Alfresco 4, and version which we<U+0092>re releasing today builds on that with support for Alfresco while also maintaining backwards compatible with the and Alfresco product There<U+0092>s so much in this release that it felt like much more than a release and seemed much more You can read on for more details of these exciting new capabilities, or go straight to the download, installation and configuration instructions to try it out Easy Configuration The first thing you<U+0092>ll notice when enabling the using Share<U+0092>s Module Deployment console is that additional modules have been added, which provide the configuration needed to bind the viewer into the document details Unless you want a specific custom configuration, you can just enable the new PdfJs Configuration module (in addition to the existing PdfJs Viewer module), click Apply Changes and you should see PDF documents will now use the new You no longer need to edit your file although if you<U+0092>ve made changes there they will continue to be Persistent View Settings Can<U+0092>t see the text clearly? You can use the zoom controls in the viewer to zoom in, our out if you want to see Or pick a preset from the and the zoom will be The next time you come back to the document, these settings <U+0096> plus the page number you were on <U+0096> will be Powerful Search Use the Search button in the toolbar or Ctrl+F (Cmd+F on MacOS) to search through the document contents for a particular item of You can easily step through the matches one by one, or highlight all matches When you<U+0092>ve found what you<U+0092>re after, you can copy the relevant text to the clipboard in order to include it somewhere else, for example in an The feature I like the most will make you wonder how you lived without it before, if you<U+0092>ve ever searched for a document in Alfresco and then struggled to find the reference to that term in the document Now, the viewer detects that you have clicked through from the search page, and automatically searches for and highlights the first match of that Just hit Enter to continue through any further matches, or Escape to close the search Link to Document The Link button in the toolbar generates a link to the document, or even to a specific page in the document, that you can send to If you want them to review Slide in your presentation then simply send them straight Improved Sidebar You can click the button on the left of the toolbar to toggle the side bar on and The side bar shows a thumbnail view of all pages in the document by default and can also show an outline of the document structure if available in the Presentation Mode At DevCon last November Jared neatly showed how you can use the the new Google Docs integration to deliver a presentation directly from your web browser using Google Drive<U+0092>s presentation mode, but with the PdfJs viewer you can now do the same thing directly from the Document Details Just click Ctrl+Enter (or Cmd+Enter on MacOS) to go , then use the left and right arrow keys to move between your slides (the arrow keys will also work in the normal Document Details view). Document Viewer Dashlet Just like Site Admins can use the Wiki dashlet to add a selected page to a site dashboard, the Document View dashlet supplied with the allows you to display any chosen document on the The dashlet works well with the PdfJs viewer, but will also work with the others supplied by the or the base viewers supplied with Share (yes, that includes the Flash document viewer, if you really want). PDFs Viewing PDFs is no longer a problem with the PdfJs You will be promoted for the password required to open the file and once supplied the viewer will work as Lots More Of course there are many other improvements that you can<U+0092>t see directly, but that you will benefit Peter has been working tirelessly to keep the version of the library , ensuring that we stay up to date with the improvements in performance and compatibility that the latest versions now We have also improved the performance of page rendering within the dashlet code itself, with improved lazy rendering of all page and thumbnail And of course PdfJs is not the only viewer in the The audio and video players are still supplied, the Embed viewer offers a compelling alternative for IE users not on IE who have the Adobe Reader or another PDF plugin installed and the Prettify viewer is great at syntax highlighting any code stored in Feedback Like all Share Extras , we welcome constructive feedback to help us to deliver the next version of Media Please use the Issues section on the project to report specific technical issues or ideas for enhancements, or general feedback can be left as comments Posted in Alfresco , Share Extras Media Viewers and Quick Share Posted on December 4, by wabson Peter helpfully put together a summary of a couple of the many different content viewers that are now provided by the Media Viewers His blog post is well worth checking out if you<U+0092>re not familiar with the Embed and PdfJs viewers, or if you have content types that you have problems previewing in Share He also pointed out something that may be obvious to some of you, but it had not occurred to me! When you add a new plugin to Alfresco<U+0092>s web preview component <U+0096> as this does <U+0096> then that is also available on the Quick Share If you<U+0092>re not familiar with Quick Share it is a great new feature originally in Cloud and now in Community , providing public sharing of documents via a short URL, which can be easily used by clicking the Share action directly above the document The result is pretty powerful, since using an iFrame you can easily add those embedded documents to an intranet page or public web page <U+0096> or just link to the items direct as Peter has done in his In fact Sergio Buitrago and I worked on this implementing this very thing as a WordPress plugin at the Berlin DevCon Hackathon last month! Latest Changes in PdfJs Viewer It<U+0092>s worth mentioning that you can try out the features Peter mentions by grabbing the project<U+0092>s latest source from In particular, here are two new features that are hot off the press in the PdfJs viewer: Perform a search in Share and click through to a PDF file or office You should see that the search function is automatically invoked for the term you searched for in the previous page, and highlights the first If you are using the latest available Firefox or Chrome browsers, you can enter mode by pressing Ctrl+F on the Now you can deliver PowerPoint presentations directly from Share itself! We are still in the process of finalising the release of the Media Viewers , so if you have feedback please file an issue on the Share Extras project site . Posted in Uncategorized DevCon Berlin rocked, now to San Jose Posted on November , by wabson So with last week<U+0092>s DevCon event in Berlin over and the second event in San Jose about to kick off, I wanted to share a few of my highlights so far, in addition to what Jeff already posted . Last week kicked off with a hackathon building on top of Alfresco, facilitated by Nathan McMinn , which I would recommend to anyone who has worked with Alfresco before and is interested in expanding their This was about people coming together to work collectively on building something in a day, and the format worked fantastically I believe Nathan will be posting soon on what was produced in the As always John and John kicked off the main sessions with the view of Alfresco, seamlessly mixing open source content management with tales from the wider IT industry and a satirical take on current global If you<U+0092>re interested in any of those things, it<U+0092>s a must I didn<U+0092>t get to see as many technical sessions as I have done in previous years, but the quality of those I did see really stood In particular: The public API live coding ( part 1 , part 2 ) session by Peter, Gethin and Steve was a great opportunity to get to grips with Alfresco Cloud<U+0092>s new public API, and like the hackathon it felt great to have some working code at the end, much aided by the sample project provided on the USB Expanding on the idea of developing your own projects, Gab Columbro<U+0092>s talk on the and Maven SDK was a highlight as much for the content as for Gab<U+0092>s style, although you<U+0092>ll want to do some background reading on Maven and how it differs from more traditional build tools before you use it for On the second day I attended Dave and Erik<U+0092>s Share Customizations Live session where they demonstrated, through the use of site presets and extensibility modules, some concrete examples which showed them taking a vanilla Share and hacking away until it was barely What was interesting was how the mechanisms for doing this have improved over the last year, and the point that often it is just as useful to remove OOTB functions as it is to add new ones, which the framework makes Jared<U+0092>s talk on our own Integrations team and what we<U+0092>ve been up to over the last year (or six months in my case), and Nathan<U+0092>s overview of PDF Toolkit and the latest new features, based on the work he<U+0092>s done recently building on Jared<U+0092>s earlier If you<U+0092>re interested in integrating Share with external systems and working with PDF content you<U+0092>ll find both sessions really Overall what stood out this year for me was the diversity of sessions available, not only in terms of topics but in their formats as There were less of the type of sessions and more richer interactive I experimented with a local Git repo in my own Developing Great Dashlets talk , switching between eight different branches of my example project to show progressively adding more features to an It was great to see others experimenting in even more ways and adding more diversity to the two If you<U+0092>re attending the event in San Jose you<U+0092>re I<U+0092>ll be presenting the same dashlets <U+0093>Zero to Hero<U+0094> talk on Day 1 and Day 2 , plus a topic on pimping the Document Details screen with your own document viewers and a lightning talk on the fantastic Leaflet . Do join if you can! Posted in Alfresco | Tagged Alfresco , DevCon CMIS support in LibreOffice Experimental Features Posted on November 1, by wabson Since I upgraded the LibreOffice installation on my Macbook to version , I<U+0092>ve been playing around with the CMIS integration built into this This is currently an experimental LibreOffice feature, which means you should not use this against a production The integration allows LibreOffice to connect to a remote Alfresco server in order to open and save This is a feature Microsoft Office has had for a long time, although limited to servers (including Alfresco, via our SharePoint protocol support !). Now you can do the same thing with LibreOffice, via the magic of The first thing to do is to enable LibreOffice<U+0092>s experimental features within the Preferences After you<U+0092>ve confirmed that change, you can open a file stored in Alfresco using the standard Open When the file browser loads, you should notice a small button next to the location menu labelled with an ellipsis (<U+0085>). Clicking that button allows you to add a LibreOffice supports a range of server types, including the CMIS AtomPub service provided by First you must enter a name for the server <U+0096> I entered <U+0091>Alfresco<U+0092> <U+0096> and select the server If you do not see CMIS (Atom Binding) in the list then check to ensure that you have LibreOffice + and that you have enabled Experimental The binding URL for Alfresco will be something like http: localhost:8080 alfresco cmisatom if you are running a local I found that if I used the legacy CMIS URL below alfresco service (or the short form alfresco s ) then document saves did not work, but the newer URL worked Next is the slightly tricky part, entering the CMIS repository Your Alfresco instance will only expose one repository, but other CMIS providers provide others, and so you need to enter Hitting the repository binding URL directly will give you the ID, but unfortunately the document MIME type returned means it does not open directly in a web You could save the response to disk and then use a text editor to view its contents, but I found it easier to use curl at the command line, together with curl admin:admin http: localhost:8080 alfresco cmisatom | less In the response, do a search for the string repositoryId and within that element you should see a GUID value which you can copy and paste into the dialogue in The last item you need to enter is the username that will be used to access Alfresco (you will enter the password later). You should now have the full set of information needed to add the Click OK, and it should be added to the side panel on the left of the Open You can navigate through the folders below the repository<U+0092>s Company Home space, and open any compatible I used the Word documents located under Sites swsdp documentLibrary Meeting Notes, which opened You can make any modifications, hit Save and the content will be automatically saved back into I also tried creating a new document from the New menu, and was able to save the document back to a folder Alfresco via the Save As I found I needed to set the correct MIME type for new documents back in Alfresco Share to get previews to work, but this could easily be done using a All in all not bad for an experimental feature, and it will be interesting to see if this makes it into LibreOffice for Posted in Alfresco | Tagged Alfresco , atompub , cmis , libreoffice New Notice Dashlet and Improvements for Developers Posted on October , by wabson Following hot on the heels of the release from last week, it<U+0092>s great to see going out this week with another bunch of improvements before DevCon . I<U+0092>ve been able to help get a few more changes into the this release, which provide a new dashlet and several improvements for Notice Dashlet This dashlet may already be familiar to some of you who have used the available from Share The Notice Dashlet allows site managers to add a custom notice that will be displayed to all site members, and allows this to be done directly from the dashlet Now you no longer need to create a wiki page just to display some basic text on the dashboard! New Bubbling event for dashlet resize notifications If you<U+0092>ve developed any complex dashlets to render maps or other graphics, you<U+0092>ll appreciate that it<U+0092>s important to know the vertical height of the dashlet when you render your That is easy to get via the Dom or using YUI2<U+0092>s () function, but what if the user resizes the dashlet? Now the resizer module can notify your listeners via the new Bubbling event dashletResizeEnd . This is fired when the resizing has been completed and passes a number of parameters in the event arguments, including the new height of the dashlet, the dashlet element and component IDs and the Dom element representing the To subscribe to the event, simply define a new custom function in your dashlet class prototype and bind it to the event in the dashlet class constructor, (""dashletResizeEnd"", , this) In your custom function you can then take any further action which is necessary, informing a map instance that the element bounds have More options for Data List actions The ability to add custom UI actions to Share<U+0092>s Document Library is well documented and the site has a number of extensions which utilize this But did you know the same thing can be done for data list items? Until now the number of actions that can be displayed in the UI has been effectively capped at But now you can easily add new actions of your own there Thanks to the work done by Dave Draper these definitions can easily be inserted into the application by using an extensibility module to customize the and As an example, the following code could be used to add the Sample Datalist Action provided by Share Extras to your datalist items, as part of an extensibility if (model.widgets) for (var i = 0 i < i++) var widget = [i] if (widget.id == ""DataGrid"") These two lines only needed if you want to show the action in the actions cell, otherwise a More actions menu will be created to display widget.options.splitActionsAt = 4 widget.options.actionsColumnWidth = splitActionsAt + 5 Add the action definition - this will be ( id: ""onActionSample"", Change to match your handler function name type: ""action-link"", permission: """", href: """", label: ""actions.datalist.mycustom"" Change to match your custom label in ) If you have attempted to customize the existing Edit and Create data list actions with your own custom form configuration, then you may also appreciate the ability to increase the width of the modal dialogs used here, which previously were Better handling of missing custom previewers This will mainly be of interest to developers and administrators working with custom viewers in the web preview component, such as the viewer in Share Extras<U+0092>s Media Viewers , and is a topic which I<U+0092>ll be talking about in San Jose next Previously, if the files implementing the viewer were unavailable for some reason then an error would be thrown in the With this change the component now logs that the viewer class could not be found, and this will also be printed on the screen if no other viewers can be Posted in Alfresco Creating SSL certificates for Solr Posted on August , by wabson Since the default SSL certificates that ship with Alfresco<U+0092>s Solr integration expired the other week I<U+0092>ve been having to fix up my local development installs that I<U+0092>d previously configured with The instructions on the wiki are pretty comprehensive, and together with the text file provided in the Solr integration package provide all the info you need to understand the process of creating your own keys and certificates for local After I stepped through the complete procedure documented there, with some slight modifications to avoid the interactive prompting, I found I had a set of commands which I could use in order to repeatedly a set of keys inside each installation directory on my The first section in the following listing could be placed inside your file, and this is recommended to ensure that the password values you choose to use are not captured in your command history or in your The commands after that should be used repeatedly against each Alfresco installation you wish to generate keys and certificates #
